Same as amstrad_150318_r003 but not using Maxam.rom and also using renamed BASIC1-1.e00 and AMSDOS.e07 instead of BASIC1-1.ROM and AMSDOS.ROM

Not using Maxam.rom does unlock somes games, as sayed Thomas Petto.

Perhaps more stable than r004 and r004.1, as it doesn't map RAM and ROM added.

It a special "oriented stable games" fork edition dedicated to Thomas Petto !

r003.1 => r003.2
